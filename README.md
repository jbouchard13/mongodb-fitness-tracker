### Description

This app lets the user track their workout plans by being able to create new workout plans. They're also able to update their last workout plan if they wish to add to it as they go. All of this data is saved to a mongoDB and their stats can be seen on the dashboard page. The user is shown a chart generated with chart.js to show them a breakdown of their workouts.

### Usage

When the user navigates to the index page, they are displayed their previous workout or a message stating that no workout exists yet. If their is one they user has the choice of continuing the existing one, or adding a new one. When adding or updating a workout plan they can choose whether it is a cardio or resistance based exercise. Depending on what they select, the user is prompted with different options to describe their exercise.
